# Predictive Maintenance Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predictive maintenance using data analytics and predictive modeling techniques.

## Project Description
Predictive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy that uses data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies and predict equipment failures before they occur. This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model implementation
- Predictive analytics for equipment failure prediction
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Files and Structure
- **Predictive maintainance.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing the main analysis and modeling workflow
- **code** - Supporting code files for the project
- **README.md** - This file

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization tools

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple ML algorithms for predictive modeling
- Model performance comparison
- Visualization of results

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MEKALA-JASWANTH/predictive.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Predictive maintainance.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and validation
5. Performance evaluation
6. Results interpretation

## Future Improvements
- Add requirements.txt for dependency management
- Include sample dataset or data description
- Add model deployment scripts
- Implement real-time prediction API
- Add unit tests for code modules
- Document model hyperparameters and tuning process
